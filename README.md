# Traffic Flow Optimization
---------------------------

### About

This is a final project of NTU CSIE Artificial Intelligence 2016 spring course.

### Introduction

We are trying to use genetic algorithm to solve heavy traffic flow problem. And we think of adjusting the durations of traffic lights in every intersections may solve this problem. However, we all know that this kind of problem is NP, so we can only using some method to get a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Then it occurs to us that we can use GA to find a not bad solution.

### Language

* Python 2.7
* Tkinter (for graphical display)
